        <div class="block block-strong">
        <p>
            Scrum is an agile framework for managing knowledge work, with an emphasis on software development. 
            It is designed for teams of three to nine members, who break their work into actions that can be completed 
            within timeboxed iterations, called "sprints", no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks, 
            then track progress and re-plan in 15-minute stand-up meetings, called daily scrums.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end of each sprint there is a short review of the results which were developed in the sprint.
            After this it is recommended to do a Retrospective of the last sprint.
            The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose.
            This is the opportunity for the Scrum Team to improve and all member should be in attendance.
            During the Sprint Retrospective, the team discusses:
        </p>
        <p>    
            - What went well in the Sprint<br>
            - What could be improved<br>
            - What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint
        </p>
        <p>
            For the Scrum Team the Restrospective is a holy ceremony, where it is possible to share one's honest opinion on an issue.
            Only with honest commulication and believe in the team, the best performance can be reached.
            And because of this the Retrospective is so important for the success of the team.
